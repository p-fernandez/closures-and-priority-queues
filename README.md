# EXECUTION

First run:
```bash
yarn docker:build:test
```
and once completed, just run:
```
yarn docker:run:test
```

The container would be deployed and will execute automatically the test suites.

# LOCAL INSTALL

For a local install just:
```bash
yarn install
```
and then just:
```
yarn test
```

So the test suites will be executed.
